# 2D_scale

In this repository are the Presentation files programming a 2D scale. 

This scale allows rating fatigue and pain sensations continuously and simultaneously.

Two versions of the scale are available here: an MRI version that requires a trigger from the scanner to start and a non-MRI version.

The program includes three conditions (6.6, 7.0, and 7.4). Since the scale is the same in all three version, only the file for condition 7.4 is uploaded here.

A licensed version of the software Presentation is needed to run this scale.
